Gameloop
	Multiple
	Progression based
		1. Alone
			The player has to run from mobs due to no offensive tools
			Find an injured adventurer (a tank)
			Get the choice to heal the adventurer
			If the player does the adventurer will swear loyalty to the player and join the player after a short dialogue

		2. Can now with the help of injured adventurer kill mobs as long as you keep the adventurer alive
			The player can now do more than the simple gathering stuff of floor quests
			Eventually the player will find a second adventurer that needs help (a dps)
			The dps will suggest doing a dungeon with just the three of them
			Wipe is all but garanteed
			The player will then be able to start recruiting more adventurers at an inn.
			Once a dungeon is cleared the clearing party members will want to stick with the healer and asks the player to lead a guild

		3. This is the start of the final? gameloop, the player can now select to send guild members out to do simple quests. Or the player can bring up to 4 of them with them to do more rewarding quests. The player can also form dungeon clearing teams, mix and matching the different guild members to beat differrent encounters

		4. Eventually the player will unlock raids which are technically just 25? person dungeons.

Guild members
	Name
	Class
		Tank
			Mitigation based tank
				Really efficient to heal but dies to quick burst or very easily if specced to the wrong type of attack
			Health pool tank
				Can almost never be oneshot but healing won't be as good on them as other tanks
			Evasion based tanks
				Very luck based, but can against slow attacking bosses go several seconds without needing a single heal
		Mdps
			Fast attacker
			Slow hard hitting attacker
			Dot based
		Rpds
			Kiting based

			Dot based
		No healers as the players character is the only healer.
	"Personality"

	Proffesion
		Allows the player to access the upgrades and gathering of resources outside the players chosen profession.
		Reduced expected gains based on personality and guild upgrades.
		The player can also assign certain jobs to instead of adding their "tax" in the form of resource donation they instead sell that portion and offers gold as tax
	Gear
		The player can assign gear upgrades
		Weapons should be more dynamic and feel like the choice of weapon will have more of an impact
			For example a rogue with can be handed a bow and then be played more like a wow hunter or if given dagger will be a faster hit and run type character, taking more damage but dealing more damage than the other classes, or if given maces will work more as a cc bot
		[Loot drama?]
			[If a guild member hasn't been given loot for a while they might turn upset and leave the guild]

Instances
	Dungeons 3-5 characters recommended
		Should have 3-5 bosses
		Inbetween bosses there should be packs of adds that need to be killed to progress
		Progress shouldnt be a straight forward, kill all ads all the time, some packs are skippable, some are directly in the way, some are patrolling and can be dodge if the player wants to risk it, sometimes the player might need to look for a switch to open a door/gate if they havent brought a rogue/blacksmith/engineer
		Some add packs, especially if you are bringing lower numbers will have to be managed with cc

	Mega dungeons 5-10 characters recommended
		10-15 bosses 
		Should be divided up into wings, basicly 3-5 dungeons merge into one, if cleared all wings unlock the final locked wing
		Otherwise pretty much similar to normal dungeons

	Raid
		3-10 bosses depening on raid size
		Each boss should have the adds before them try to teach the mechanics but divvied up among the packs
