World
	Procedually generated
		First a town network will be generated
			This is so certain questlines can continue to other cities
			Every town will have a level range, usually around 5 levels
				Neighbouring towns will have some overlap on these ranges

		Secondly a biome map will be generated
		Thirdly terrain features will be generated
			Rivers, oceans, mountains, lakes

	Generated into chunks by biome, further divided into tiles
		Inbetween the biomes there should be a "borderlands" biome containing tiles, entites, and doodads from both biomes

	Names
		The npc names will randomly generated
 			Consisting of a first name with 1 to 3 set of syllables
 			The last name will be drawn from either a list (for major story characters) or composite from two lists (for guild members and normal npcs) [Ah, Green, etc + berg, strom, etc]
 	
 	Divided up into areas
 		Tutorial island
 			Levels 1 through 10
 		Open world
 			Towns [Villages, cities, etc]
 				Large quest hubs
 					Mostly procedually generated questlines
 				In centres of towns there will be waystone that if the player have completed enough quests in the area they can use to travell to other waystones
 				Depending on a [corruption, decay smthg like that] value will determine how safe the roads in the area is.

 			Hamlets
 				Small quests hub
 					Longer questchains but most of the steps are hand crafted
 					Usually has a quest that takes u to the closest city and back

 			

 		Dungeons
 			15-60
 			Randomly generated the first time they are entered, after that it will be the same dungeon
 			[Modifier system?]
 				[Example of modifiers could be like a chaotic system that randomizes the dungeon everytime]
 			Should aim to give roughly 1.5 levels worth of exp in the level 15 dungeons to roughly 0.05 at level 59 dungeons
 				Quests should be a huge chuck of the exp, making repeat clears still pretty good but not better than open world questing
 			Dungeons should be easiest to find through doing a quest and getting a quest that guides you there

 		Raids
 			25-60
 			Not randomly generated

 			Should give roughly 1 level worth of exp per clear, but should be aimed to be impossible to clear on the first try
 				The main reward should be the loot upgrades
 					The biggest grandest quests should end in raids
 	Religion
 		12 gods
 			Creation
 			Isolation/Self
 			Community
 			Youth/Freshness/Growth
 			[Construction]
 			Sun/Moon/Fire

Gameloop
	Multiple
	Progression based
		1. Alone (Level 1-15)
			The player has to run from mobs due to no offensive tools
			 Find an injured adventurer (a dps)
			 Get the choice to heal the adventurer
			 If the player does the adventurer will swear loyalty to the player and join the player after a short dialogue
			 Can now with the help of injured adventurer kill mobs as long as you keep the adventurer alive
			 The player can now do more than the simple gathering stuff of floor quests

		2.  Eventually the player will find a second adventurer that needs help (a tank)
			 The dps will suggest doing a dungeon with just the three of them
			 Wipe is all but garanteed but the first two bosses should be doable by most players
			 The player will then be able to start recruiting more adventurers at an inn.
			 Once a dungeon is cleared the clearing party members will want to stick with the healer and asks the player to lead a guild

		3. This is the start of the [final] gameloop, the player can now select to send guild members out to do simple quests. Or the player can bring up to 4 of them with them to do more rewarding quests. The player can also form dungeon clearing teams, mix and matching the different guild members to beat differrent encounters

		4. Eventually the player will unlock raids which are technically just [25] person dungeons.

	Proffesion
		The guildmembers will learn proffesions
			At first at their own volition/time but after enough upgrades have been made they can be ordered around

		Allows the player to access the upgrades and gathering of resources outside the players chosen profession.
		Reduced expected gains based on personality and guild upgrades.
		The player can also assign certain jobs to instead of adding their "tax" in the form of resource donation they instead sell that portion and offers gold as tax

	Gear
		The player can assign gear upgrades
		Weapons should be more dynamic and feel like the choice of weapon will have more of an impact
			For example a rogue with can be handed a bow and then be played more like a wow hunter or if given dagger will be a faster hit and run type character, taking more damage but dealing more damage than the other classes, or if given maces will work more as a cc bot

		[Loot drama?]
			[If a guild member hasn't been given loot for a while they might turn upset and leave the guild]




NPC
	The player can right click to interact with NPC in range of them
		If the NPC have multiple roles (eg. QG and seller the player will be brought to an intermediate screen where they can select what they want to do)

	Quest givers
		Certain NPC have quests that the player can accept and complete and then turn in for a reward.

		Sellers have a subset of a list of items they can sell to the player
			This list will have [30] items and upon creation the npc will pick 0-2 from different level ranges

				If the player doesnt buy it/notices it within the time window there is a increasing chance the item will be gone the next refresh




Magic Schools
	Holy - Order
		Gives benifits to the caster if certain spells are cast in order

		Overtime focused

	Water
		Tidal, periods of activity followed by periods of weakness that get extended by using magic

	Earth

Party
	The player can while in the guild buildings [at first only there] select a team to bring out into the world

			Should aim to be roughly, 1x for 2, [0.5] for 3, [0.2] for 4, [0.15] for 5]
			This is to cause interplay between efficency with not being able to do all quests in a zone

Town buildings
	Religious building
		Allows the player to replenish long cooldowns as well as mana/health

	Town hall
		A lot of quests are offered to the player/guild here
		A good place for part 2 and 3 to find more members

	[Farm Instances]
		While the player can find the resources they offer in the world the most efficent way to get them should be in their respective instance, some however can be found in the ones they dont belong, for example a lone pine species that can only be found in the flower field or an plant that only grows underground can only be found in the mines.

			Those items can be accessed through any bank

		Should aim for [10] bank slots for ever 1 inventory slot

	Shops
		Has NPC that will trade with you

	Auction house
		Can buy almost all items for a price
			The rare the item the pricier, way more pricier than any shop
				If you missed an rare item in a shop you might just see it in here for sale
			
				Can buy out the auctionhouse inventory
					This is PRICY

			Most materials work similar to the stockmarket, price varies with time, you can pretty easily flip things for profit.



Instances
	Dungeons [3]-5 characters recommended
		Should have 3-5 bosses
		Inbetween bosses there should be packs of adds that need to be killed to progress
		Progress shouldnt be a straight forward, kill all ads all the time, some packs are skippable, some are directly in the way, some are patrolling and can be dodge if the player wants to risk it, sometimes the player might need to look for a switch to open a door/gate if they havent brought a rogue/blacksmith/engineer
		Some add packs, especially if you are bringing lower numbers will have to be managed with cc

	Mega dungeons 5-[10] characters recommended
		10-15 bosses 
		Should be divided up into wings, basicly 3-5 dungeons merge into one, if cleared all wings unlock the final locked wing
		Otherwise pretty much similar to normal dungeons

	Raid
		3-10 bosses depening on raid size
		Each boss should have the adds before them try to teach the mechanics but divvied up among the packs
