# Single Player MMO

A solo project experimenting with MMO-style mechanics in a single-player setting.  
This project simulates the complexity of a healer role inside an RPG environment, blending UI, combat systems, and modular design.

## Features

- **Healer Systems**  
  Core mechanics for managing health, resources, and support actions.  

- **UI Elements**  
  Custom status bars for health, mana, and targets.  
  Toggleable frames and windows for player information.  

- **Input Handling**  
  Keybinds and command parsing for in-game actions.  

- **Documentation**  
  Linked Obsidian vault (`/Features`) with notes explaining design choices and code snippets.

## Goals

- Simulate MMO-style healer gameplay without requiring multiplayer.  
- //Serve as a teaching tool for addon/UI design and modular Lua systems.  
- Explore Obsidian as a documentation layer for game projects.

## Status

This is a **work-in-progress prototype**.  
Expect incomplete features, experimental code, and placeholder systems. The focus is learning, documentation, and demonstrating complex design in a solo environment.  

---

## Future Work

- Add combat log and encounter scripting.  
- Improve UI polish and frame scaling.  
- Write complete syntax documentation.  
- Package a demo with screenshots or a video walkthrough.
